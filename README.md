# Personal NeoVim Setup

Critique it all you want, if it works for me it works for me y'know.

For plugins and other things I want to implement, see [TODO.md](/TODO.md)

## Dependencies

### ripgrep

You'll need to install `ripgrep` on your preferred terminal. Since I'm a Mac user, I used `brew install ripgrep`.
